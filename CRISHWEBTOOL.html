    <p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>

    <p>
        This is to formally announce that the tools and content associated with my recent post are 
        officially shut down effective immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have decided to discontinue and disable access due to unauthorized usage and redistribution. 
        It has come to my attention that many individuals have been using, reselling, and profiting 
        from the materials I personally worked hard to create.
    </p>

    <p>
        As the original creator, I value the time, effort, and dedication invested in developing 
        this content. Unauthorized selling and misuse are unacceptable and violate my rights 
        as the owner.
    </p>

    <p>
        Therefore, all permissions to use, share, distribute, or sell this material are hereby revoked.
        Any continued use after this notice will be considered unauthorized.
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for your understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sincerely,<br>
        [CRISH CPM]
